      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am Aldo Scamardella. I am currently working for a company that makes upcycled leather bags and I am learning to code so that I can have a career in this field.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Venezuela but moved to the United States at the age of five and grew up in Los Angeles.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Thanks to COVID I've jumped back into playing video games, I also enjoy hiking, though I haven't done much of it here in Jersey. I enjoy reading and eating just about anything that tastes good to me.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would just have to be something that isn't a job but more of a lifestyle, something that I can wake up to every day and truly enjoy doing and that fulfills me, but can of course help to pay the bills.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in New Brunswick, NJ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I chose to get into this field because as a child I was extremely creative, I played violin and other instruments. I loved drawing comics and writing stories, but now, as an adult I've lost that creative side of me. So I began to look for something that would provide me with a creative outlet to once again get those parts of my brain working and I believe coding can provide me with that, while at the same time making a career out of it.</p>
